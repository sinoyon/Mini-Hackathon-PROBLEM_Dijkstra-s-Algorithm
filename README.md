# Mini-Hackathon-PROBLEM_Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
This Project illustrates and provide a visualization of the best and shortest path from one specific state to another that are connected. We decided to work on Malaysia map to provide the shortest distance from Sebak Bernam state to any other state of Malaysia. We would like to apply our knowledge learnt in Data structure II class to help Sebak Bernam people to find the optimal distance to any state in order to help them to be on time by spending less cost. • Solving with Dijkstra’s Algorithm Graph • Solving with Dijkstra’s Algorithm in C++
